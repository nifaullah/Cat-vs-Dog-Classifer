# Cats & Dogs Classifer
Use CNN with Keras to classify Dog &amp; Cat Images

**Goal:**

1. To succesfully apply the concept of Convolutional Neural Network to large scale data.
2. Build a classifier which successfully differentiates Cats and Dogs

**Data:**

<a href ="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765">Dogs vs Cats dataset from Microsoft</a> is used to train and build a convolutional neural network model to distuingish cats from dogs. The dataset consists around 25000 images equally divided into cats and dogs.


**Approach:**

First I downloaded the dataset to my local and then uploaded it to my Google Drive so that I can use it in Google Colab. Afterwars I prepare the data by purposely reducing the quality of each image for 2 reasons one there may not be such high quality images to classify and other being reduction in comptational cost such that the images can still be recognized to some extent

**Results:**

After 10 or so iteration 89% train accuracy and 88% test accuracy is not bad but ceratinly can be improved. I believe the Classifier performance can be certainly improved, in future iterations I'll try to further reduce bias and variance.
